#################### Basic Parameters ####################
## Absolute paths are recommended for workdir and sample_reads_list_file
# workdir: Dir contains sample_read.list and will store result files.
workdir: "example/example_short_reads"
# sample_reads_list_file: File name of sample_read.list. Must located in wirkdir.
sample_reads_list_file: "1.sample.reads.list"
# split_chr: (False or True). Weather split by chromosome for parallel running. This is useful for multi-node clster. This option can greatly reduce the memory usage in augment mode. If you only own one computer-node the recommended setting is False. Default is True.
split_chr: True
# mode: (genotype or augment). `genotype` mode will genotype SVs in the graph-genome. `augment` mode will extract novel SNPs and SVs for each sample. Default is `augment`.
mode: "augment"
# Graph-based reference should be renamed as `Ref.gfa` and then placed in `workdir`. This value is not recommand for modifing! Default is `Ref`.
graph: 'Ref'


#################### More parameters ####################
# mapper: can be either 'map' or 'gaffe', Default id `gaffe`
mapper: 'gaffe'
